# pdf-automation-project
Automates certificate generation using Python by extracting participant data from Excel and creating formatted PDF certificates."

This project automates the generation of Letters of Reference and Certificates of Internship using participant data stored in an Excel file. Instead of manually creating certificates for each student, the system reads all details from the Excel sheet and automatically generates well-formatted PDF certificates based on predefined templates.

The Streamlit interface makes the process easy and interactive — users can upload an Excel file, preview results, and download all generated certificates with just a click. This automation significantly reduces manual effort, ensures consistency across certificates, and eliminates human errors.

# My Contributions

I played a key role in building the core functionality of the Certificate & LOR Automation System. My main contributions include:

1️⃣ QR Code Generation & Security Integration

Designed and generated unique QR codes for every student/participant.

Ensured each QR code is linked to a unique ID.

Integrated QR codes into both Certificates and Letters of Reference (LORs).

Implemented logic to automatically place QR codes in the correct position on each template.

2️⃣ Data Extraction & Processing

Built the module to extract student details from Excel using Python.

Cleaned, validated, and mapped Excel data fields to the certificate/LOR templates.

Ensured smooth handling of multiple records for batch certificate generation.

3️⃣ System Integration & Workflow Automation

Integrated three separate parts of the project into one working solution:
✔ Data extraction
✔ Template design
✔ QR code generation

Connected all modules together through a single automated workflow.

4️⃣ Streamlit Setup & Final Deployment

Installed, configured, and integrated Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface.

Helped in the final deployment steps and ensured the complete system worked end-to-end.
